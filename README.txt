-7. the project requires you to login with the instagram credentials for your instagram user(https://www.instagram.com/millchannel/) which i set to be a test user in the app. Before you do that, you have to log into your instagram account, go to (Profile Icon) > Edit Profile > Apps and Websites, and under TESTER INVITES accept to be a test user for the app, so the app can access your data.
	-if you want to test the app with another instagram account, email me to let me know, and i will set your instagram account as a test user for the app. (you can't run the app until this step is completed)
